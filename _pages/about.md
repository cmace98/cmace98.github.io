WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION :)

I am a graduate student at The Ohio State University. I work with Annika Peter in the [Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics](https://ccapp.osu.edu/) to understand the nature of dark matter. My work is primarily computational, and focuses on the evolution and observational signatures of a class of dark matter candidates called self-interacting dark matter.
